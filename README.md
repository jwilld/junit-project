# Java JUnit testing

## About

This repository contains a testing reflection report and a JUnit testing assignment.

## Takeaways

- Testing is important for ensuring software functions properly. A developer writing tests for their own code can create bias--leading to poor tests. One way to eliminate bias is coverage. Coverage identifies missing tests and test cases. Another way is to have a peer, coworker or outside agency test the code. The more distant the tester, the less bias the tests. Overall, this should confirm functional and secure code. 

- Developing software starts with user requirements. The requirements have to be translated to code by identifying types, functions, and limits. With enough detail tests can be written before coding and the developer can use test-driven development (TDD). With TDD, coding takes place until all tests pass. Coverage should be run once this is complete.
